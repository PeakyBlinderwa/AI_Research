# Generative_AI_Research_47639339

This repository is created as part of the REIT6811 tutorial to demonstrate data handling, GitHub collaboration, and generative AI usage in academic research.

## Overview

This project explores the role of generative AI tools in academic settings, examining their potential benefits and challenges. It includes both qualitative and quantitative analysis, literature reviews, and related drafts.

## Repository Structure

- `Literature Review documents/` – Academic articles and reference papers used in the study.
- `Qualitative Analysis/` – Analysis of open-ended survey questions and word cloud activity.
- `Quantitave Analysis/` – Statistical analysis and graphs related to lecture attendance and grades.
- `Drafts and Reports/` – Progress reports and written drafts for final submission.
- `Additional Materials/` – Supporting files and reference data.

## Collaboration Guidelines

- **Branching:** Please create feature branches (e.g., `analysis_update`, `draft_v2`) and merge them to `main` after review.
- **Commits:** Use clear and descriptive commit messages (e.g., `Added cleaned survey data and analysis script`).
